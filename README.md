## About
This is a [Nextstrain](https://nextstrain.org) build for novel coronavirus, alternatively know as hCoV-19 or SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. This build is visible at [andersen-lab.com](andersen-lab.com).

### Data
The hCoV-19 / SARS-CoV-2 genomes included in this build are those shared by GISAID and the [SEARCH-Alliance](https://searchcovid.info/). To access these sequences and see more information on how they have been produced, checkout [HCoV-19-Genomics](https://github.com/andersen-lab/HCoV-19-Genomics).

**Disclaimer**. Please note that this data is still based on work in progress and should be considered preliminary. If you intend to include any of these data in publications, please let us know – otherwise please feel free to download and use without restrictions. We have shared this data with the hope that people will download and use it, as well as scrutinize it so we can improve our methods and analyses.
